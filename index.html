        Indian scientist and politician who played a leading role in the development of India’s missile and nuclear
        weapons programs.
        He was president of India from 2002 to 2007.</p>

        <h2 id="about">About the Legend</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958
                joined
                the
                Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).</li>
            <li>In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research
                Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was
                both
                designed and produced in India.</li>
            <li>Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of
                successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni,
                India’s
                first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
                in
                1989.</li>
            <li>From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
                scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister.</li>
            <li>Kalam wrote several books, including an autobiography, Wings of Fire (1999).</li>
            <li>In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put forward Kalam to succeed outgoing
                President
                Kocheril Raman Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva) NDA even though he was
                Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian
                National Congress, also proposed his candidacy.</li>
            <li>Upon returning to civilian life, Kalam remained committed to using science and technology to transform
                India
                into a developed country and served as a lecturer at several universities. </li>
            <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam created the Technology Vision 2020 project in 1998. The project sought to develop
                India’s
                economy through technology, particularly as applied to agriculture, and increase the availability of
                health
                care and education. In recognition of Kalam’s services to the country and broad popularity, the National
                Democratic Alliance nominated him for president in 2002.</li>
            <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam won many awards, both from the Indian government and from the international
                community.
                His most notable awards were the Padma Vibhushan, won in 1990, and the Bharat Ratna, won in 1997, for
                his
                contributions to science and engineering and service to the government.</li>
            <li>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam attended the Madras Institute of Technology, where he received a degree in
                aeronautical
                engineering in 1960. After graduation he joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation
                (DRDO)—an
                Indian military research institute—and later the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). Kalam’s
                associations were not limited to research organizations: he was also associated with political groups,
                such
                as the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).</li>
